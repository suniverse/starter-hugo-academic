I am an assistant professor in the Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University. I am fond of discovering fundamental physical laws from the vast observation of various astrophysical objects. My research areas are high energy astrophysics, plasma astrophysics and cosmology. My research topics cover a broad range of physical scales: from the smallest fundamental particles like electrons and ultralight axions, to neutron stars, black holes and galaxies, and to the largest scale structure of the universe.
